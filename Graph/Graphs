Graphs: Most useful and most used ds in cs when it comes to modeling real life
- set of values that are related in a pairwise fashion 
- Node: each item 
- Edges: nodes are connected with edges 

Graphs 
    Trees
        Linked List

Types of Graphs 

1. Directed: Movement is not bidirectional
    Twitter
2. Undirected: HighWay you can go back and ford 
    Facebook 

3. Unweighted: NO cost on the edges between nodes
4. Weighted: cost on the edges between nodes
    Fastes way to get from one node to another
    most efficient way to visit cities

5. Cyclic: a cycle exists you can always go back to the original node
    Weighted graphs 
6. Acyclic: no cycle present

DAG = Directed Acyclic Graph
