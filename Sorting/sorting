Really important for interviews

As more and more data is handled by our computers which is a big trend in computing, 
sorting and searching are two of the biggest computer science problems in the software world

Sorting Algo:
Elementary Sort
    1. Bubble Sort
    2. Insertion Sort
    3. Selection Sort
More complex algo
    4. Merge Sort
    5. Quick Sort

Bubble Sort: bubbling up the largest value using mutiple pass through
6 5 3 1 8 7 2 4 
5 6 
5 3 6
5 3 1 6 
5 3 1 6 8
5 3 1 6 7 8
5 3 1 6 7 2 8 
5 3 1 6 7 2 4 8 
And repet this over and over until is sorted
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Not the most efficient because we need a lot of comparisons
time complexity O(n^2) space O(1)


Selection Sort: works by scanning a list of items for the smallets element and then swapping that element for the one in the first position 

Insertion Sort: 
preforms really well when we work with small data 
builds up a sorted list one item at a time. It iterates through an unsorted list, and for each item, it finds the position where the item belongs in the sorted list and then inserts it there
